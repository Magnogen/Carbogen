Carbogen takes inspiration from multiple languages, including:
- Lisp
- JavaScript
- Java
- Minecraft Datapacking
- Discord Bot Interaction
- Assembly Language

Tbh I have no idea what contributes the most. Each aspect of the language is taken from a different feature.

[Rigaux's Very Helpful Syntax Exploration](http://rigaux.org/language-study/syntax-across-languages.html) is an incredible source of information for this.
It provides a lot of ideas for ways I could implement certain features, as well as keeping some things similar to other languages.
I'd definitely recommend checking it out!
